BUG: unable to use the escape key to exit out of any of the interface options
  such as weapon editing or hull editing, I am stuck on those screens


BUG: Editing weapon groups with no assigned weapons
  G, right arrow
  causes crash



Variant: Improve workflow for multiple weapon groups / linked / alternating / autofire.


load all shipsystems
- propagate system ID's to enum "system.id" and use in CSV mode
- show system name and description in CSV mode instead of bar graph
- (?) show CSV "defense ID" in this context as well

support weapons in mode 5

support weapon csv data in mode 6

projectiles in mode 7

fix shitty performance in complex non-TSubroutine modal functions
- use static memory allocation and stateful transitions

zoom-to-cursor (UGH)

- key to Set CSV line to blank

- Allow to Type in values for the angle & firing arcs on weapons?

CSV - preserve blank lines and row-order

ship-mounted engine graphic previews

ship-mounted weapon graphic previews

phase effect preview

add zoom-out effect to CSV row id list (it's too long), (dirty hacks ftw)

Load new graphic (I): request permission from user to clear out (new) all data. ship hull, variant, csv.

- To create "maneuvering jets"
  set the otherwise-unused "contrailSize" field to 128 to flag the engines as hidden
  They'll be activated by any system that modifies the engine glow.
