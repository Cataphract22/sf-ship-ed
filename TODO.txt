- weapon groups visualizations
  when in 2/G mode, make all the weapon slots blink that belong to the same group
  as the one selected in the text box.

- enhancement: string filtering for weapons list
  mouse control?

- maybe bring in menu/gui objects from other project

support weapons in mode 5

support weapon csv data in mode 6

projectiles in mode 7

zoom-to-cursor (UGH)

CSV - preserve blank lines

ship-mounted engine graphic previews

ship-mounted weapon graphic previews

phase effect preview

To create "maneuvering jets"
  set the otherwise-unused "contrailSize" field to 128 to flag the engines as hidden
  They'll be activated by any system that modifies the engine glow.

Variant: Improve workflow for multiple weapon groups / linked / alternating / autofire.

load all shipsystems
- propagate system ID's to enum "system.id" and use in CSV mode
- show system name and description in CSV mode instead of bar graph
- (?) show CSV "defense ID" in this context as well
