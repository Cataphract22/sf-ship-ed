- 0.6a compatibility update
	- silently ignore trailing "f" in floating-point number literals
	- "alwaysAnimate" now works for beam weapons, too
	- Rows starting with a '#' in .csv files will now be skipped
	- Engine styles:
			Can now be specified directly under "style" (i.e.: "style":"midlineFlare", as opposed to "style":"CUSTOM","styleId":"midlineFlare"). Old way still works.
			All vanilla engine styles can be overridden using engine_styles.json
			Styles for LOW_TECH, MIDLINE, and HIGH_TECH extracted to engine_styles.json (as examples)
	- Made ship hull styles fully moddable (shield color, explosion color, etc)
			Configured in data/config/hull_styles.json
			Can add new, fully-custom styles
			Can set custom engine/shield/etc sounds per style in sounds.json (see "engine_loop" for an example, can use custom style IDs there)
	- Added PD_ONLY weapon hint
			Must be used with PD hint
			PD + PD_ONLY -> weapon will only target missiles
			PD + PD_ONLY + ANTI_FTR -> weapon will only target missiles and fighters
	- Hulls can now have built-in hullmods
			"builtInMods" key in .ship file
			see data/hulls/crig.ship for an example
	- do not save DECORATIVE or SYSTEM mounts when saving variants

--------------------------------------------------

- Uomoz's bug with saving stuff

- weapon groups visualizations
  when in 2/G mode, make all the weapon slots blink that belong to the same group
  as the one selected in the text box.

- enhancement: string filtering for weapons list
  mouse control?

- maybe bring in menu/gui objects from other project

support weapons in mode 5

support weapon csv data in mode 6

projectiles in mode 7

zoom-to-cursor (UGH)

CSV - preserve blank lines

ship-mounted engine graphic previews

ship-mounted weapon graphic previews

phase effect preview

To create "maneuvering jets"
  set the otherwise-unused "contrailSize" field to 128 to flag the engines as hidden
  They'll be activated by any system that modifies the engine glow.

Variant: Improve workflow for multiple weapon groups / linked / alternating / autofire.

load all shipsystems
- propagate system ID's to enum "system.id" and use in CSV mode
- show system name and description in CSV mode instead of bar graph
- (?) show CSV "defense ID" in this context as well

ability to hide/show decorative mounts
